# **Create a script that demonstrates how Pickling and Structured error handling work**  
  
## **Introduction**  
In this assignment, I will document how I created a Python script that demonstrates how pickling and structured error handling work. This program asks a user to input a name of a household item and its value, and then both pieces of data are stored in a binary file. The pickle module was used in my script for storing and retrieving the data in the binary file. In addition, I used try and except to handle the exception that might be raised in the process.

### *Creating a New Project in PyCharm*  
To begin with this assignment, I created a new project in PyCharm with the folder location “_PythonClass/Assignment07” (Figure 1).
